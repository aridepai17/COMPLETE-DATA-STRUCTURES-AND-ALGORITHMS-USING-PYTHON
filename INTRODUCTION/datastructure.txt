WHAT IS A DATA STRUCTURE?

-> Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

-> Set of instructions to perform a task.
-> Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task.

WHAT MAKES A GOOD ALGORITHM?
 
-> Correctness
-> Efficiency

TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES:

1. PRIMITIVE
    -> Integer
    -> Float
    -> String
    -> Boolean

2. NON-PRIMITIVE
    -> LINEAR
        -> List
        -> Tuple
        -> Array
        -> Linked List
        -> Stack
        -> Queue

    -> NON-LINEAR
        -> Graph
        -> Tree
        -> Dictionary
        -> Set

TYPES OF ALGORITHMS

1. SORTING
    -> To sort data in ascending or descending order.

2. SEARCH 
    -> To find a specific value in a data set.

3. GRAPH
    -> To work with data that can be represented as a graph.

4. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
    -> To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

5. DIVIDE AND CONQUER
    -> To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the results.

6. RECURSIVE
    -> To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems that are similar in nature.
